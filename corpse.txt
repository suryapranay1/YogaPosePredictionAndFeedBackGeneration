Lie down comfortably on your back with your legs slightly apart and arms by your sides.
Relax your entire body, letting go of any tension or effort.
Close your eyes and focus on your breath, allowing it to become slow and natural.
Resist the urge to fidget or adjust your position once you're settled.
Stay in the pose for at least a few minutes to fully relax and rejuvenate.
