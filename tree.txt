Ensure a stable and firm footing before lifting your foot off the ground.
Engage your core muscles to help maintain balance.
Avoid placing the foot directly on the knee joint to prevent strain.
Use a nearby wall or chair for support if needed, especially if you're a beginner.
Keep your gaze fixed on a stable point to help with balance.
