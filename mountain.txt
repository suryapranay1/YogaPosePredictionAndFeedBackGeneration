Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and distribute your weight evenly.
Engage your thigh muscles and lift your kneecaps to support your legs.
Lengthen your spine, drawing your shoulders down and away from your ears.
Keep your gaze forward and your chin parallel to the ground.
Ground down through your feet and feel a sense of stability and strength.
